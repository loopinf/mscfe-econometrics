In this lesson, we are going to use all the time series knowledge we have learned and apply it to this lesson. We are going to introduce the ARIMA model. The ARIMA model combines the AR model and MA model as one model for time series analysis. The Box-Jenkins method provides all the modeling steps for the ARIMA model so the Box-Jenkins method and ARIMA model can be used interchangeably. We will talk about what the ARIMA model is and how to apply it to analyze a time series. Before talking about the ARIMA model, let's start with the ARMA model.*"

    "In figure 8, we produce a number of graphs for model diagnostics. The first one is the standardized residuals graph. We can see from the residuals graph that there is a period where the variation is higher than other periods. In the next module, we will introduce a method to model non-constant variance for time series data. In the ACF plot for the residuals, the ACFs below lag 5 are not significant. However, lag 6 to lag 9 are still significant. There might be seasonality activity that the model does not capture. From the QQ plot for the residuals, we can see the residuals are not normally distributed since the plot shows fat tails on both ends. The last graph is the Ljung-Box test. What is the Ljung-Box test?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ljung-Box test is to test if a group of autocorrelations from model residuals are small enough to claim the residuals are independent. The test conducts $n$ hypothesis tests for the following $n$ autocorrelation groups: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Group 1: autocorrelation 1 <br>\n",
    "> Group 2: autocorrelation 1, autocorrelation 2 <br>\n",
    "> Group 3: autocorrelation 1, autocorrelation 2, autocorrelation 3 <br>\n",
    "> $\\quad \\vdots$ <br>\n",
    "> Group $n$: autocorrelation 1, autocorrelation 2, autocorrelation 3, …., autocorrelation $n$ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each hypothesis test is constructed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Null hypothesis $H_0$: all autocorrelations in the group are small enough so that residuals are independent\n",
    "> - Alternative hypothesis $H_1$: all autocorrelations in the group are not small enough so that the residuals are not independent\n",
    "\n",
    "If the $p$-value from each hypothesis test is $> 0.05$, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. We then conclude that residuals from this model are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what the Ljung-Box test is, we can look at the test graph report in figure 8. From the plot, we see that the groups with lags equal to and less than 5 are all not significant. However, from lag 6 and afterwards, there are some autocorrelations that exist from Ljung-Box Test. Combining this piece of information with ACF plot for residuals, we see there might be a seasonality component that the model neglects to capture.\n"

    "In this lesson, we introduced the ARMA model and ARIMA model. We first went through the definitions and properties of ARMA and ARIMA models. We then introduced the Box-Jenkins method to build an ARIMA model. We used the example of Google's stock price to demonstrate the model identification, estimation, and model diagnostics steps to build an ARIMA model. We also showed the model's forecast result. This lesson concludes the introductory module on time series analysis. So far, we have assumed that variation in a time series is constant. However, in financial data, this is not always the case. In the next module, we will learn how to model time series with non-constant variance. \n"
