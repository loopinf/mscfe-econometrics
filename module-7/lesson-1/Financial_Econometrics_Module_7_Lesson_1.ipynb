    "From figure 2, we can see the trend in the stochastic model is going up and is similar to the case for the deterministic model. However, a stochastic model has a squiggly line instead of a smooth line as in a deterministic model. This squiggly pattern comes from the fact that the variable annual interest rates applied to each month are different. Unlike a deterministic model, at time 0, the stochastic model cannot predict a precise number for what the account balance will be by the end of the year. We know the variable annual interest comes from a normal distribution with a mean of 40%, but we do not know the definite numbers. What we can do is sample 12 numbers from the distribution and apply them to the model to predict the account balance in a year. This is what we did in this example. However, if we repeat the same prediction process—sample another 12 numbers from the distribution and apply them to the model—we will very likely get another predicted account balance in a year. Every time we repeat the prediction process, we get a different account balance. The key difference between the deterministic model and stochastic model is that the prediction from the deterministic model is always the same no matter how many times one repeats the prediction process. However, the prediction outcome will be different from a stochastic model each time a researcher repeats the prediction process as shown in the following plot.\n"

    "In the last section, we learned that a stochastic model would generate a different prediction outcome for each prediction run due to the random component within the model. The prediction outcome of a stochastic model is not definite. We can generate samples from independent random variables in a stochastic model and apply them to the model to derive one predicted outcome. In the last section, we drew three sets of sampled data to generate three predicted lines in figure3. We can repeat the process multiple times, and we will get multiple predicted cumulative account balances. These predicted outcomes will form a distribution. We can calculate the average and use the average as our final prediction for the cumulative account balance. However, how accurate is this averaged cumulative account balance? We can use the variance derived from the distribution from sampled data to conduct statistical tests to check the accuracy of the averaged outcome. This technique is called Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. \n",

    "Figure 4 shows the histograms of predicted account balance distribution with a different number of trials. We can see as the number of trials increases, the shape of the histogram will become more concentrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In figure 4, we can see as the number of trails increases, the average predicted year-end account balance converges to 162.5. We can see when the number of trials increases to 1,000 runs from 100 runs, the average drops a lot and then stays very stable around 162.5. Also, the width of the confidence intervals drops a lot from 1,000 runs to 100 runs. From these two numbers, we can say 1,000 trials are enough to get convergent results for a year-end account balance estimator.\n"

    "In this lesson, we introduced some new concepts to set the foundation for learning agent-based modeling later. We first discussed deterministic models, that is, models without any random component or uncertainty within the model. When one uses a deterministic model for prediction, the prediction outcome is certain. Then, we considered stochastic models, i.e., models with a random component. Because of the randomness, if one runs simulations many times and uses simulation results, the predictions obtained will in general be different for different simulations. In order to analyze multiple prediction outputs, we introduced the concept of Monte Carlo simulation. A Monte Carlo simulation repeatedly samples data from the model to generate predicted outcomes and perform inference about the model. With these concepts in hand, we move on to introduce agent-based modeling in the next lesson.\n"
