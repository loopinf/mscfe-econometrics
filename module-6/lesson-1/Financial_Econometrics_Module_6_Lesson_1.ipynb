    "In Lesson 1 of  Module 4, we introduced the notions of weak stationarity and strict stationarity for time series. If a time series is weak stationary, the mean is constant and independent of time location; the autocorrelation of any two data points in the time series will only depend on the time difference but not on the time locations of the data points. For strict stationarity, the joint probability of the time series data points is the same when time shifts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The property of stationarity of a time series shows up in many time series models. In an ARMA model, the time series is required to be stationary before modeling. There are also coefficient restrictions in both the Box-Jenkins method and GARCH model to ensure the modeled process is stationary. We have seen the importance of being stationary for a time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned from Module 4 that there are two methods to possibly turn a non-stationary time series into a stationary one: detrend the time series or difference the time series. If a non-stationary time series fluctuates along a straight trend in the plot, it means this time series tends to reverse back to its long-term trend after deviating from it. If we can remove this long-term trend and the detrended time series is stationary, then we call the original time series a **trend-stationary time series**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we can take a first difference of a non-stationary time series and turn it into a stationary time series, we call this original time series a **difference-stationary time series**. Identifying what type of non-stationary time series we have for analysis will help us to properly prepare the data before modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Module 4, we usually use ACF and PACF plots or time plots to check if a time series is stationary or non-stationary. Even though these visual methods are very straightforward to understand, oftentimes, these methods are very precise. In the following sections, we will introduce some formal methods to test a time series for stationarity. These methods can provide us with more rigorous checks and results for the stationary character of a time series.\n"

A stationary time series with no unit root is integrated with order zero, or $I(0)$. In our case, $v_t$ is $I(0)$. If we take first difference of $I(1)$, the new time series will be $I(0)$.

    "In this lesson, we introduced a unit root test to test for stationarity of a time series. We first described what a unit root is. We then introduced the first unit root test: the Dickey Fuller Test. We went through the basic theory and the three versions of the test. Although we do not use Dickey Fuller test as much now, it serves as a good base test to understand the next test: the augmented Dickey Fuller test. ADF is the most popular unit root test nowadays. We also went through its theory and the three versions of the test. We then discussed the KPSS test. This is another unit root test that can be used to compliment the ADF test. Finally, we used Google's stock price as an example to run through the ADF test and KPSS test. We showed how to read the results from the tests and draw conclusions. This lesson concludes our study of analysis of univariate time series or one time series. In the next few lessons, we will start to study two or more time series and analyze their interactions. \n"
