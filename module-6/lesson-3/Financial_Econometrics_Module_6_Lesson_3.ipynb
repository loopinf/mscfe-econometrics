DW test is a test to check for autocorrelation for residuals of a model. The DW statistic has a value between $0$ and $4$. When the DW statistic is close to $2$, there is no autocorrelation.

In this section, we are going to introduce methods to test for two time series to see if they are cointegrated. First, we will introduce the **Engle-Granger two-step procedure**. We'll call it the EG test for short in this lesson. This is a popular method to test for cointegration. In the next lesson, we will introduce another method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Engle and Granger (1987) proposed a method to test for cointegration of two time series. The EG test is based on the definition of cointegration we discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of EG test is as follows. Assume $x_t$ and $y_t$ are two $I(1)$  time series. We first run the following OLS regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_t + u_t $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $u_t$ is the residuals and $\\beta_1$ is the cointegration coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we call $u_t$ an equilibrium error since it measures the deviation of the actions of $x_t$ and $y_t$ from long-term equilibrium. Then, we run an augmented Dickey-Fuller test on $u_t$ to see if it has a unit root. If $u_t$ has a unit root, it means that $x_t$ and $y_t$ are not cointegrated. If $u_t$ has no unit root, then $x_t$ and $y_t$ are cointegrated. However, there is a twist. Since $u_t$ is a residual from an OLS regression of two time series, we cannot use the regular Dickey-Fuller table to decide the critical values for testing. Phillips and Ouliaris (1990) (**PO Test**) provided a method and tables for critical values to check for unit roots for residuals. Instead of the ADF test, Phillips and Ouliaris use another popular unit root test, the Phillips-Perron Test, to check for unit root and generate the tables. In general, these types of tests we are using are **residual-based tests for cointegration** since we check residuals for unit root to decide cointegration. We also call it a **single equation approach** as we only run one OLS regression. The $H_0$ and $H_1$ of the test is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $H_0$: $u_t$ has unit root (non-stationary) / $x_t$ and $y_t$ are not cointegrated <br>\n",
    "> $H_1$: $u_t$ does not have unit root (stationary) / $x_t$ and $y_t$ are cointegrated\n",
    "\n",
    "If we reject $H_0$ and confirm $x_t$ and $y_t$ are cointegrated, we say the estimate of $\\beta_1$ from the OLS regression is **super-consistent**. Super-consistent means the sample estimate converges to the true population parameter. We do not need to take the difference of $x_t$ and $y_t$ before running an OLS regression. We do not have to worry about the spurious regression issue when $x_t$ and $y_t$ are cointegrated.\n",

In section 2, we went through the situation when two time series are cointegrated, the residuals of their regression will be stationary. We also discussed the fact that when time series are cointegrated, there exists a long-term equilibrium among them. We have already seen many different financial data moving in different directions in short term but in the long run they display a consistent relationship. How can we use what we have learned about cointegration to build a financial model and analyze the behavior of cointegrated non-stationary time series? The error correction model provides an answer for us. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "However, we would like to build a model that can include both long-term relationships and short-term fluctuations. We still want $y_t$ to be the dependent time series and $x_t$ to be an independent time series. We also will include lag terms $x_{t-1}$ and $y_{t-1}$ so the model can account for the impact of time series in the previous time points. Now, we can write a new regression model as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_t = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_t + \\theta_2 x_{t-1} + \\phi y_{t-1} + u_t $$\n",

Also, since $x_t$ and $y_t$ are cointegrated, the residuals $\\epsilon_t$ from their regression will be $I(0)$ too. Therefore, in ECM regression, all our terms are stationary. We will not have the spurious regression issue. <br>\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**c)** $\\lambda[\\epsilon_{t-1}]$: This is the error correction term in the regression. This is the part of the regression that captures the long-term dynamics of $x_t$ and $y_t$. What does it mean? Say at time $t-1$, $\\ \\epsilon_{t-1}$ is positive. It means $y_{t-1}\\gt \\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_{t-1}$. Hence, there is a disequilibrium happening for $x$ and $y$ at $t-1$. Assume $\\lambda$ is negative. At time $t$, according to the regression model, $\\lambda$ is negative, $\\epsilon_{t-1}$ is positive, and $\\Delta y_t$ will be negative at time $t$. It means that at time $t$, $\\ y$ will decrease in order to return to a long-term equilibrium state. This is why this term is called the error correction term and why this model is called error correction model. This term provides the ability to model the force to bring short-term data deviation back to a long-term equilibrium state. $\\lambda$ is called the error correction coefficient. It adjusts the speed at which the data will go back to its long-term equilibrium state. In order to have the error correction function work, we need to make sure that $\\lambda$ is negative. Some literature will say $\\lambda$ needs to be positive because they separate the negative sign out from $\\lambda$. Be careful when you read other ECM materials. We usually require $\\lambda$ to be between $0$ and $-1$ since in most cases the full adjustment does not happen right away. <br>\n",

    "In this lesson, we looked into when we may have to run a regression on non-stationary time series. We discussed the issue of spurious regression. We then introduced the concept of cointegration among two non-stationary time series. If the two time series are cointegrated, we can run an OLS regression without issue. Lastly, we introduced the error correction model, which can model both the short-term activity and long-term equilibrium of two cointegrated time series. In next lesson, we will extend our analysis to multiple time series.\n"
